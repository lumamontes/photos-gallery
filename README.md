### Photos Gallery Website

This website is a photo gallery built using Next.js, Contentful, Cloudinary, and Tailwind. Its primary function is to showcase a portfolio of images, along with sample text for context. The website sources its data from Contentful CMS and utilizes static site generation for its page rendering.

Key features of the site include a photo gallery with images for each project, an about page, and a contact page with a Web3Forms-powered form. The site also leverages the Cloudinary API for image manipulation, such as blur backgrounds, and has detailed pages for each photo, which are created using static paths.

This website was based on the image gallery template from [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example), and the original demo is available [here](https://nextconf-images.vercel.app/)
